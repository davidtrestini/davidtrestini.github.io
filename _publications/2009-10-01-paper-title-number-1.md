excerpt: 'We compute the gravitational waves generated by compact binary systems in a class of massless scalar-tensor (ST) theories to the 1.5 post-Newtonian (1.5PN) order beyond the standard quadrupole radiation in general relativity (GR). Using and adapting to ST theories the multipolar-post-Minkowskian and post-Newtonian formalisms originally defined in GR, we obtain the tail and non-linear memory terms associated with the dipole radiation in ST theory. The multipole moments and GW flux of compact binaries are derived for general orbits including the new 1.5PN contribution, and comparison is made with previous results in the literature. In the case of quasi-circular orbits, we present ready-to-use templates for the data analysis of detectors, and for the first time the scalar GW modes for comparisons with numerical relativity results.'
