### Abstract

The inspiral phase of gravitational waves emitted by spinless compact binary systems is derived through the fourth-and-a-half post-Newtonian (4.5PN) order beyond quadrupole radiation, and the leading amplitude mode (l,m) = (2,2) is obtained at 4PN order. We also provide the radiated flux, as well as the phase in the stationary phase approximation. Rough numerical estimates for the contribution of each PN order are provided for typical systems observed by current and future gravitational wave detectors.
