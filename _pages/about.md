# My research

My research concerns the analytic modelling of gravitational waves from compact binary systems using perturbative methods in general relativity. The main goal of my work is the construction of precise and physically transparent *dictionaries* between gravitational-wave signals and the properties of their sources, such as masses, spins, and orbital configurations. These waveform models are the main fuel for gravitational-wave data analysis and astrophysics.  

I work primarily within general relativity, but I have also developed waveform models in alternative theories of gravity, in particular scalar–tensor theories.

## Post-Newtonian theory

Most of my work uses the post-Newtonian approximation. This consists in assuming that the source of the gravitational waves, which is a compact binary of black holes or neutron stars, has an orbital velocity that is small with respect to the speed of light. Equivalently, this means that they are well separated. At leading order, the motion is simply given by Newton's law of gravitation; one then computes corrections to this as an expansion in $v_\text{orb}/c$, where a correction in $(v_\text{orb}/c)^{2n}$ ($n\in\mathbb{N}$) is said to be of $n$PN order. The 1PN correction leads to the periastron advance, whereas the 2.5PN correction drives the radiation reaction. The latter is linked to gravitational wave emission, whose leading order is given by Einstein quadrupole formula; corrections to the latter are also counted in PN order. 

## Gravitational self force

Recently, I have been interested in waveform modelling within the self-force framework, which is adapted to extreme mass ratio inspirals (EMRIs), which are composed of a primary (massive) black hole of mass $m_1$ and a secondary (light) compact object of mass $m_2$. The viewpoint here is to consider, at leading order, the geodesic trajectory of a test particle around a Schwarschild or Kerr black hole. Since the secondary has a finite mass, its trajectory deviates from a geodesic due to its *self force* by corrections of order $\epsilon = m_2/m_1$. The self force has both conservative and dissipative contributions. The amplitude of the gravitational waves emitted by such systems are suppressed by the mass ratio, but are still expected to be detectable by LISA. The leading-order contribution to the gravitational waves is called ''adiabatic'' (0PA) and is linked to the dissipative piece of the first-order self force (1SF). The sub-leading order contribution is called ''post-adiabatic'' (1PA) and is much harder to compute: it requires both the conservative 1SF and the dissipative 2SF.
