# My research

The unifying theme of my research is using perturbation theory to develop of an accurate *dictionary* between gravitational waves and the objects emitting them. I'm interested of course in general relativity, but also in alternative theories of gravity, such as scalar tensor theories.

## General relativity

### Post-Newtonian waveform templates

### Interplay between self-force and post-Newtonian expansions

## Scalar-tensor theories
