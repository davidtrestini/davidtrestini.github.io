I am a post-doctoral researcher at the STAG Research Group at the University of Southampton. 
My CV is downloadable here:
<center><a href="../files/CV.pdf" download="David_Trestini_CV.pdf"><button class="btn btn--custom">Curriculum vitae</button></a></center>

My main research interest is the development a *dictionary* between compact binaries systems and the gravitational waves they generate.
